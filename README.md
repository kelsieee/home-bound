# More About The Project

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Start Page 

When users first load the Home:Bound website, they view the Start Page. The Start Page aims to warmly welcome
new users with some opening text and preludes their experience with a property wallpaper and navigation bar. 
Our logo also has a place on the top right. 

<br>

## Profile Icon 

The user is brought to a page which consolidates and makes editable their profile details, such as their profile
picture, security information, etc. 

<br>

## Saves Icon 

The listings users choose to save are consolidated here. Users can access them by clicking on this button. 

<br>

## Homepage

The homepage contains a collection of lodging and roommate listings, which can be saved by clicking on the 
"Save" icon on each listing for future reference as the user pleases. 

<br>

### Lodging Listings

International university students can search for available accommodation by browsing lodging listings. 
They are identified by the brown "LODGING" label on the listings, which contain details about the type
of property listed by landlords, such as the number of bedrooms, available facilities, etc.

<br>

### Roommate Listings

Roommate listings, distinguished by the green "ROOMMATE" label, present information, such as one's name,
age, hobbies, etc, about other users who are in search of other student roommates. A user looking for
compatible roommates can do so by browsing these listings.

<br>

### Navigation bar

Our navigation bar has three input avenues: the location, search bar and duration of stay. A filter button 
completes the navigation bar on the extreme right.

<br>

#### Location 

International university students can enter their preferred location of the accommodation they are
looking to rent. 

<br>

#### Search bar 

Users can enter keywords to shortlist lodging and/or roommate listings.


#### Duration

Through a calendar widget, users indicate their desired stay duration in terms of days.

<br>

### Filter Button 

Students can search for lodging and roommate listings based on specifications indicated through this 
filter widget. Upon clicking the filter button, the user is presented with a dually-segmented dropdown 
(for roommates and accommodation). 

<br>

#### Roommates Filter

Users can sieve out roommate listings based on their inputted cleanliness preference, with a description
for the best and worst cases of the scale, and acceptance towards overnight visitors. These criteria are
represented by a sliding bar and a set of radio buttons respectively. 

<br>

#### Accommodation Filter

Lodging listings which are within the price range indicated by the user through a sliding bar and contain
the number of rooms preferred by the user based on their marked checkbox options are presented to them.

<br>

## Roommate Profile

Our users can create a Roommate profile so as to share more information about themselves (such as those 
aforementioned). Other users who are interested in finding roommates can browse their profile to find 
out more about the user, and can contact him via the social media details indicated on the page.

<br>

## Listing As A Landlord

Home:Bound also welcomes users who are keen on renting out their properties to potential student tenants. 
They can create lodging listings by clicking on the Plus button on the navigation bar, where they will 
    be directed to a separate page to upload photos of their property, share more about the utilities, and 
    other details about their lodgings.
