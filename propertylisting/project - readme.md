# How do I use Home:Bound?

    # Start Page 

    When users first load the Home:Bound website, they view the Start Page. The Start Page aims to warmly welcome
    new users with some opening text and preludes their experience with a property wallpaper and navigation bar. 
    Our logo also has a place on the top right. 

    # Profile Icon 

    The user is brought to a page which consolidates and makes editable their profile details, such as their profile
    picture, security information, etc. 

    # Saves Icon 

    The listings users choose to save are consolidated here. Users can access them by clicking on this button. 

    # Homepage

    The homepage contains a collection of lodging and roommate listings, which can be saved by clicking on the 
    "Save" icon on each listing for future reference as the user pleases. 

        # Lodging Listings

        International university students can search for available accommodation by browsing lodging listings. 
        They are identified by the brown "LODGING" label on the listings, which contain details about the type
        of property listed by landlords, such as the number of bedrooms, available facilities, etc.
 
        # Roommate Listings

        Roommate listings, distinguished by the green "ROOMMATE" label, present information, such as one's name,
        age, hobbies, etc, about other users who are in search of other student roommates. A user looking for
        compatible roommates can do so by browsing these listings.

    # Navigation bar

    Our navigation bar has three input avenues: the location, search bar and duration of stay. A filter button 
    completes the navigation bar on the extreme right.

        # Location 

        International university students can enter their preferred location of the accommodation they are
        looking to rent. 

        # Search bar 

        Users can enter keywords to shortlist lodging and/or roommate listings.

        # Duration

        Through a calendar widget, users indicate their desired stay duration in terms of days.

        # Filter Button 

        Students can search for lodging and roommate listings based on specifications indicated through this 
        filter widget. Upon clicking the filter button, the user is presented with a dually-segmented dropdown 
        (for roommates and accommodation). 

            # Roommates Filter

            Users can sieve out roommate listings based on their inputted cleanliness preference, with a description
            for the best and worst cases of the scale, and acceptance towards overnight visitors. These criteria are
            represented by a sliding bar and a set of radio buttons respectively. 

            # Accommodation Filter

            Lodging listings which are within the price range indicated by the user through a sliding bar and contain
            the number of rooms preferred by the user based on their marked checkbox options are presented to them.

    #  Roommate Profile

    Our users can create a Roommate profile so as to share more information about themselves (such as those 
    aforementioned). Other users who are interested in finding roommates can browse their profile to find 
    out more about the user, and can contact him via the social media details indicated on the page.

    # Listing As A Landlord

    Home:Bound also welcomes users who are keen on renting out their properties to potential student tenants. 
    They can create lodging listings by clicking on the Plus button on the navigation bar, where they will 
    be directed to a separate page to upload photos of their property, share more about the utilities, and 
    other details about their lodgings.

# What username/password details should I consider?

user is a legitimate university student and hence, eligible to be consumers of Home:Bound. 

Subsequently, they log in using said email and a password they create.
